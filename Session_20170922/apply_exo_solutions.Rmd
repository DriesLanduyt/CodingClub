# Apply

## Exercises 

```{r}
#create a dummy community dataset
(comm <- matrix(rpois(50,2),nrow = 5,dimnames = list(paste("Site",1:5),paste("Species",1:10))))

#Easy
#compute species richness per site
apply(comm,1,function(x) sum(x>0))

#compute in how many sites each species occur
apply(comm,2,function(x) sum(x>0))

#compute the mean abundance of species with more than 2 individuals in each site
apply(comm,1,function(x) mean(x>2))

#compute the relative abundance (save the object for later use)
ps <- apply(comm,1,function(x) x/sum(x))

#Medium
#compute the exponential of the shannon diversity for each site
apply(ps,2,function(x) exp(-sum(x*log(x),na.rm=TRUE)))

#Hard
#turn the abundance into classes, turn the species with highest abundance into a "D" all others with abundance superior to 0 into "S" and species of 0 into "A" (save the object)
doms <- apply(comm,1,function(x) ifelse(x == max(x), "D",ifelse(x>0,"S","A")))

#count how often each species is dominant
apply(doms,1,function(x) sum(x == "D"))
```

#lapply

## Exercice

```{r}
#Easy
#get the range for each column in the dataset
lapply(mtcars,range)

#compute the coefficient of variation for each columns in mtcars
#help CV = mean / sd
lapply(mtcars,function(x) mean(x)/sd(x))

#compute the 0.25, median and 0.75 quantile for each columns
lapply(mtcars,quantile,probs=c(0.25,0.5,0.75))

#Medium
#compute the correlation between a random vector of normal deviates and each columns, hint: you have to use a function with more than one argument
rnd <- rnorm(nrow(mtcars))
lapply(mtcars,function(x,cov) cor(x,cov),cov=rnd)


#Hard
#get the car name which get the maximum value for each colmuns
lapply(mtcars,function(x,row_name) row_name[which.max(x)],row_name=rownames(mtcars))
```

# sapply

## Exercice

```{r}
#Easy
#put the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of each column into a nice table
#hint you can re-use sum_stat to get nice row names
sum_stat <- function(x){
  return(c(Mean=mean(x),Std.Dev.=sd(x),CV=mean(x)/sd(x)))
}
sapply(mtcars,sum_stat)

#Medium
#standardize all variables in the dataset
sapply(mtcars,function(x) (x-mean(x))/sd(x))

#Hard
#create function that removes outliers based on some varying threshold
#by default an outlier is an observation that is more or less than 1.5 * (Q75 - Q25)
out_dect <- function(x,thresh=1.5){
  qs <- quantile(x,probs=c(0.25,0.75))
  lims <- c( qs[1] - thresh * (qs[2] - qs[1]),qs[2] + thresh * (qs[2] - qs[1]))
  return(x < lims[1] | x > lims[2])
}
#remove all outliers from the mtcars dataset with a threshold of 1.5
#try to find out how to still end up with a data frame at the end
sapply(mtcars,function(x) ifelse(out_dect(x),NA,x))
```


# mapply

## Exercice

```{r}
#Easy
#repeat the car names (rownames) as many times as they have gears
mapply(rep,x=rownames(mtcars),times=mtcars$gear)

#Medium
#repeat species names per sample depending on their abundance
mapply(rep,x=colnames(comm),times=comm)
```

#plyr
