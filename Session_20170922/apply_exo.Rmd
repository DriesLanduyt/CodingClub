# Apply

## Exercises 

```{r}
#create a dummy community dataset
(comm <- matrix(rpois(50,2),nrow = 5,dimnames = list(paste("Site",1:5),paste("Species",1:10))))

#Easy
#compute species richness per site

apply(comm, 1, function(x) sum(x>0))
apply(comm>0, 1, function(x) sum)

#compute in how many sites each species occur
apply(comm, 2, function(x) sum(x>0))

#compute the mean abundance of species with more than 2 individuals in each site

apply(comm, 1, function(x) mean(x[x>2]))

#compute the relative abundance (save the object for later use)
ps <- apply(comm, 1, function(x) x/sum(x))

#Medium
#compute the exponential of the shannon diversity for each site
apply(ps,2,function(x) exp(-sum(x*log(x, base = exp(1)), na.rm=T)))


#Hard
#turn the abundance into classes, turn the species with highest abundance into a "D" all others with abundance superior to 0 into "S" and species of 0 into "A" (save the object)
doms <- apply(ps, 2, function(x) ifelse(x=max(x), 'D', ifelse(x=0,'A', 'S')))

#count how often each species is dominant
apply()
```

# lapply

## Exercise
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```


```{r}
#Easy
#get the range for each column in the dataset
lapply(mtcars, function(x) max(x) - min(x))
lapply(mtcars, range)

#compute the coefficient of variation for each columns in mtcars
#help CV = sd/mean
lapply(mtcars, function(x) sd(x)/mean(x))

#compute the 0.25, median and 0.75 quantile for each columns
lapply(mtcars, function(x) quantile(x, c(0.25,0.5,0.75)))
lapply(mtcars,quantile,probs=c(0.25,0.5,0.75))

#Medium
#compute the correlation between a random vector of normal deviates and each columns, hint: you have to use a function with more than one argument
rnd <- rnorm(nrow(mtcars))
lapply(mtcars, function(x) cor(x,rnd))


#Hard
#get the car name which get the maximum value for each colmuns
lapply(mtcars, function(x) rownames(mtcars)[which(x==max(x))])
lapply(mtcars, function(x) rownames(mtcars)[x==max(x)])

```

# sapply

## Exercise

```{r}
#Easy
#put the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of each column into a nice table
#hint you can re-use sum_stat to get nice row names
sum_stat <- function(x){
  return(c(mean =mean(x), sd =sd(x), CV= sd(x)/mean(x)))
}
sapply(mtcars, sum_stat)

#Medium
#standardize all variables in the dataset
sapply(mtcars, function(x) (x-mean(x))/sd(x))

#Hard
#create function that removes outliers based on some varying threshold
#by default an outlier is an observation that is more or less than 1.5 * (Q75 - Q25)
out_dect <- function(x,y=1.5){
  Q25 <- quantile(x,c(0.25))
  Q75 <- quantile(x,c(0.75))
  th <- y*(Q75-Q25)
  out_rm <- ifelse(x < (Q25 -th) | x > (Q75 +th), NA, x )
  return(out_rm)
}
#remove all outliers from the mtcars dataset with a threshold of 1.5
#try to find out how to still end up with a data frame at the end
sapply(mtcars,out_dect)
```


# mapply

## Exercise

```{r}
#Easy
#repeat the car names (rownames) as many times as they have gears
mapply()

#Medium
#repeat species names per sample depending on their abundance
mapply()
```

#plyr

## Exercise

```{r}
#we have a a list of community matrices
comm_li <- list(comm,comm+2,comm+rpois(50,1))

#make a data frame with the species abundance over the site
ldply(comm_li, function(x) colSums(x))
ldply(comm_li, function(comm) apply(comm,2,sum))

#make a data frame with species richness per site
ldply(comm_li,function(x) rowSums(x>0))

#plot an histogram of species abundance for each site
l_ply(comm_li, function(comm) barplot(comm, beside=TRUE))
```
