# Apply

## Exercises 

```{r}
#create a dummy community dataset
(comm <- matrix(rpois(50,2),nrow = 5,dimnames = list(paste("Site",1:5),paste("Species",1:10))))

#Easy
#compute species richness per site
apply()

#compute in how many sites each species occur
apply()

#compute the mean abundance of species with more than 2 individuals in each site
apply()

#compute the relative abundance (save the object for later use)
ps <- apply()

#Medium
#compute the exponential of the shannon diversity for each site
apply()

#Hard
#turn the abundance into classes, turn the species with highest abundance into a "D" all others with abundance superior to 0 into "S" and species of 0 into "A" (save the object)
doms <- apply()

#count how often each species is dominant
apply()
```

# lapply

## Exercise

```{r}
#Easy
#get the range for each column in the dataset
lapply()

#compute the coefficient of variation for each columns in mtcars
#help CV = mean / sd
lapply()

#compute the 0.25, median and 0.75 quantile for each columns
lapply()

#Medium
#compute the correlation between a random vector of normal deviates and each columns, hint: you have to use a function with more than one argument
rnd <- rnorm(nrow(mtcars))
lapply()


#Hard
#get the car name which get the maximum value for each colmuns
lapply()
```

# sapply

## Exercise

```{r}
#Easy
#put the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of each column into a nice table
#hint you can re-use sum_stat to get nice row names
sum_stat <- function(){
  
}
sapply()

#Medium
#standardize all variables in the dataset
sapply()

#Hard
#create function that removes outliers based on some varying threshold
#by default an outlier is an observation that is more or less than 1.5 * (Q75 - Q25)
out_dect <- function(){
  
}
#remove all outliers from the mtcars dataset with a threshold of 1.5
#try to find out how to still end up with a data frame at the end
sapply()
```


# mapply

## Exercise

```{r}
#Easy
#repeat the car names (rownames) as many times as they have gears
mapply()

#Medium
#repeat species names per sample depending on their abundance
mapply()
```

#plyr

## Exercise

```{r}
#we have a a list of community matrices
comm_li <- list(comm,comm+2,comm+rpois(50,1))

#make a data frame with the species abundance over the site
ldply()

#make a data frame with species richness per site
ldply()

#plot an histogram of species abundance for each site
l_ply()
```
